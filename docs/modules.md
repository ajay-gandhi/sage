# Modules

Sage operates on a set of "modules", bits of code that enable you to ask new
questions. New modules can simply be dropped into the `modules` folder.

Here is an introductory list of the modules that come with Sage. If you'd like
to develop your own, see the [Developing](developing.md).

Each of these questions must be asked with your hotword.
