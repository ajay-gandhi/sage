# Modules

Sage operates on a set of "modules" - bits of code that enable you to ask new
questions. New modules can simply be dropped into the `modules` folder.

Here is a list of the modules that come with Sage. If you'd like to develop your
own, see the [Developing docs](developing.md).

Each of these questions must be asked along with your hotword.

* [Email](#email)
* [Jokes](#jokes)
* [Time](#time)
* [Weather](#weather)
* ~~News~~ _(coming)_
* [WolframAlpha](#wolframalpha)

### Email

Informs you of up to 3 unread emails (sender and subject).

* Do I have any new mail?
* Read me my email.

### Jokes

Tells a joke using your name.

* Tell me a joke.
* Make me laugh.

### Time

Tells you the time or date.

* What time is it?
* What day is it?
* What is today's date?

### Weather

Today's weather forecast.

* How's the weather?
* Do I need a jacket?

### WolframAlpha

Perhaps the most powerful module, the WolframAlpha module enables you to ask
almost any question. Some examples:
